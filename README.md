# MS-predation-TWW
This study shows that protist predation significantly reduces E. coli survival in soils irrigated with treated wastewater. Using microcosms and network analysis, it identifies key bacterivorous protists responsible for top-down control, highlighting protists' ecological role in mitigating health risks associated with wastewater reuse in agriculture
